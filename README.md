In this mini-project, we will build an RNN model using LSTM layers which can predict future Google stock prices based on prices of the previous 60 days. When we say the stock price we are referring to the opening price here. It is impossible to predict stock prices exactly as they are influenced by several factors but we can predict some trends.

We will train our model on five years(from 2012 to 2016) of Google stock prices and we will try to predict for the first month of 2017.
